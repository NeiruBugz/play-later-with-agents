# Infrastructure Deployment Plan: Gaming Collection Platform

## Scope
- Deploy production-ready AWS infrastructure for the gaming collection/playthrough tracking platform
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform with proper state management
- Support ECS Fargate API deployment, S3+CloudFront frontend, and PostgreSQL database
- Include authentication (Cognito + Google OAuth), monitoring, and security best practices
- Each task is atomic, tested via `terraform plan/apply`, and committed using Conventional Commits

## Implementation Strategy
- **IaC Tool**: Terraform with remote state (S3 + DynamoDB)
- **Environment Strategy**: Staging → Production deployment pipeline
- **Security-First**: Least privilege IAM, encrypted storage, VPC isolation
- **Cost-Optimized**: Right-sized resources with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration from day one

## Per-Task Checklist
- Create/update Terraform configurations in `infra/` directory
- Run `terraform plan` and validate expected changes
- Apply changes: `terraform apply` with approval
- Validate deployment: health checks, connectivity tests, security scan
- Update documentation: resource inventory, access procedures
- Commit with specified Conventional Commit message
- Tag infrastructure version for rollback capability
